A car rental system in Java, console-based, typically involves managing a fleet of cars, handling customer reservations, and tracking rental transactions. 
Here's a brief outline of what such a project might entail:

Car Class: Create a class to represent a car with attributes such as make, model, year, license plate, rental status, etc. Include methods to set and get these attributes.

Customer Class: Implement a class to represent a customer with attributes like name, contact information, and a list of rented cars. Include methods to add and remove rented cars.

Rental System Class: This class would manage the overall rental system. It would contain methods for renting a car, returning a car, displaying available cars, displaying rented cars, and handling reservations.

Main Class: This would be the entry point of the program. It would handle user input and interact with the Rental System class to perform various operations like renting a car, returning a car, etc.

Data Persistence: Implement functionality to save and load data (like car and customer information) to and from files. This ensures that data is not lost when the program exits.

Validation: Add validation checks to ensure that users cannot rent a car that is already rented or return a car that hasn't been rented.
